# JavaScript Budget Demo
# *To start: clone directory, navigate to directory in command line and run 'open index.html'*

##  This demo allows a user to track a personal budget by inputting income and expenses, tracking each entry in a list, and then tallying the total budget. Individual expenses and combines expenses are also tracked as a percentage of the total budget. 

## Of note, this project demonstrates some of the more difficult JavaScipt concepts such as: **closures, IIFEs, DOM manipulation, constructors and protoypes**
